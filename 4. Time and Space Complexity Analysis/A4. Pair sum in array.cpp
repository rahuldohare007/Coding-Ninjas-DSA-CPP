/*
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) and a number 'num'. Find and return the total number of pairs in the array/list which sum to 'num'.
Note:
Given array/list can contain duplicate elements. 

Sample Input 1:
1
9
1 3 6 2 5 4 3 2 4
7
Sample Output 1:
7
Sample Input 2:
2
9
1 3 6 2 5 4 3 2 4
12
6
2 8 10 5 -2 5
10
Sample Output 2:
0
2

Explanation for Input 2:
Since there doesn't exist any pair with sum equal to 12 for the first query, we print 0.

For the second query, we have 2 pairs in total that sum up to 10. They are, (2, 8) and (5, 5).

int pairSum(int *arr, int n, int num)
{
     int count=0;
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
         for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
             if(arr[i]+arr[j]==num){
                 count++;
             }
         }
     }
 return count;
}
